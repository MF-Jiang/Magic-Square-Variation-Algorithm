# Magic-Square-variation-algorithm
The Magic Square variation algorithm can deal with 30th order magic square problem within 100s. (Junior AIM course work)

Based on VNS algorithm, other heuristics are used to complete the magic square change problem.

I tried Python, C/C++, but the C++ version worked better.

See my report for details.
